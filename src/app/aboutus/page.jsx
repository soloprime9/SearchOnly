      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">About FondPeace</h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        FondPeace is an independent, community-driven social media and discussion
        platform built to support meaningful conversations, original content
        creation, and transparent online interaction.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In an internet environment increasingly shaped by noise, misinformation,
        and artificial engagement, FondPeace exists to offer a calmer, more
        responsible alternative. The platform focuses on real people, real
        voices, and real discussions — without manipulation, hidden agendas,
        or forced virality.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        FondPeace is not designed to chase attention at any cost. Instead, it is
        built with long-term trust, community safety, and user freedom at its
        core.
      </p>

      {/* WHAT IS FONDPEACE */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">What is FondPeace?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        FondPeace is a modern social and community platform that allows users to
        share posts, participate in discussions, explore trending topics, and
        connect with others around shared interests and ideas.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The platform blends elements commonly found in social networks and
        discussion communities — similar in concept to Instagram, X (Twitter),
        Threads, and Reddit — while maintaining a strong focus on transparency,
        responsibility, and content quality.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Users can publish original content, engage in conversations, follow
        topics, and interact with posts in an environment designed to prioritize
        clarity over chaos.
      </p>

      {/* WHY IT EXISTS */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Why FondPeace Exists</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The internet has grown rapidly, but not always responsibly. Many platforms
        rely heavily on algorithmic amplification, sensational content, and
        engagement-driven mechanics that often reward outrage rather than
        understanding.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        FondPeace was created to take a different path — one that values balanced
        discussion, independent thinking, and respectful participation.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The goal is not to maximize screen time, but to build a platform where
        users feel comfortable sharing ideas without fear of manipulation or
        artificial pressure.
      </p>
