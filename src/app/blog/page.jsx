According to Google, its main purpose of organize world's information and providing useful information. But here is one thing that the Google will be going to die, but why. We will cover here all information and give you accurate knowledge that what do you want to do

Google is collects global data from websites and other sources and categories them in their niche and when the user is going to search query to know about then the Google is loads search results, here google is giving the search results on keywords. 

Google is not directly giving fraud or any spam answer, they are using many algorithms and technics to maintain of giving accurate and fully correct search results to users, when the search results are in front of users, after visits website user can find their fully satisfied query's answer. I think t that google is working so hard to maintain all of these like to collect info and give accurate results to their users. Here is one thing that the Google is working like as so hard and smart then how it is going to down, it's a big question from some years.

Now in the industry of tech, like as google search engines are going to call Traditional search engines, because there are lots of AI chatbot and search engine comes in tech market, and they are replacing traditional search engines place, from some years users are not want to search query to visit and find info, they are want to find latest and correct knowledge via giving query to AI, and they are found the answer without going to websites to search and read full articles to collect the information, 

Here in the formate there are the lots of AI products and AI Search Engines are available to give the perfect knowledge to users without going to visiting on Websites. AI is really going to doing smartly to get the knowledge to user. But in traditional search engines are giving users queries search results to find the knowledge, so the user are being smart and for not doing all of this, they are planning to using, and they are uses AI to find the accurate and correct knowledge, which is AI Generated content. 

Now we are going to know that the How AI search engines are giving the query's answer to users without going to suffering on websites. Firstly, AI are using models which want data to lean and then give the correct answer via the query. So there are lots of AI, which all of them using collects data from many methods like as scraping and mores. 

After collecting the data, they are to train their models to give the perfect answer of the query's. For giving users latest and trendy information, Many AI search engines using mostly scraping by following rules of websites, and some of AI don't follow the rule of the website, and they collect information and give the query is answer to users. 

## How AI Search Engines Scrape Mostly Latest content from websites
Here are more AI search Engines are available, which all of them using methods are using technics to collect the knowledge data from the websites. They are like as using to scrape or collect info using BeautifullSoup, Selenium, Puppeteer, requests, proxies, and more to collect information via website without getting blocks, they are using many proxies to rotate the Website address, that if the website blocks theirs one proxy then they will use another proxy to collect data. This is one type of methods, but there are more methods available, that they are uses to do it all.

## Cleaning of collected Data
When they are successfully collect the data, then they are using many methods to clean up the data. These methods clean up like as stop words, special characters, numbers, advertising ads, links and more. AI Search Engines cleaning Data for AI models, to find the correct data to ghastly train their models. After cleaning data, they send their data to train or summarize data to give the correct information.

How to get the correct and accurate answers of user's queries
After collecting data, This AI platform send collected data to their models and give command to give perfect sum arise and accurate answers of query. For giving the correct answer they are using more commands to give the perfect data in well-structured form like as paragraphs, headings, tables, lists and more. Now the more AI tools give the source link of content, to get the full info about the content, that they are collect are found information from which websites. When the users click on source link, they will redirect to websites. 


## Why users choose AI search Engines above the traditional search Engines
AI search engines give the fast and mostly correct answer of query and where traditional search engines give first search results, where more websites show and clicking on website users read the full answer and after reading and know the info. But in the AI search result, there are more benefits of using them, when the users are going to visits on search query page, they entered query and after clicking on Button search query, in a second they are finding the accurate and correct answer of their queries, without getting or suffering on many websites. AI search engines gives the data in well-structured form. 

## Now we are going to cover topics of codings, which give the fast and correct answers
In the Traditional search engines, they are give the websites to find the codes, if the users is searching about codes of anything, want to learn, creating codes, or anything users search about development or solution of codes. In AI search Engines, they provide the fast and correct codes to the query. But Traditional search engines not gives like as this, so the many experts are saying that the web developments and codings like as jobs is in danger, because the AI is faster than writing codes is faster than Human. So in future in many sector AI will replace the jobs of Humans. So here is, AI search Engines are winning the game of writing codes faster than traditional search engines and humans.
